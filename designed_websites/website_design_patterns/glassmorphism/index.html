Description: Glassmorphism is a design trend that mimics the appearance of frosted glass. It typically features a semi-transparent background with a blurred effect, layered over colorful or vibrant backgrounds. The effect gives a sense of depth and layering.
Key Features:
Blurred Backgrounds: Use CSS properties like backdrop-filter: blur(10px); and background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3); to create a frosted glass effect.
Transparency: Semi-transparent layers to allow background colors and shapes to show through.
Soft Shadows and Borders: Use subtle shadows and border-radius to enhance the glassy look.
Example: Ideal for card designs, modals, and overlays on colorful or gradient backgrounds.
