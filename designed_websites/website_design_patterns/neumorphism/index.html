Description: Neumorphism is a blend of skeuomorphism and flat design, giving UI elements a soft, extruded plastic look. It uses shadows and highlights to create a 3D effect.
Key Features:
Soft Shadows: Use dual shadow effects (light and dark) to create a beveled appearance.
Minimal Colors: Often uses monochromatic color schemes with slight variations in brightness.
Smooth Curves: Rounded corners and smooth transitions enhance the soft, tactile feel.
Example: Commonly used for buttons, sliders, and switches in minimalist interfaces.
