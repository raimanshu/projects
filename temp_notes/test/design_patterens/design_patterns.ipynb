    "## Factory Method\n",
    "\n",
    "What is it?\n",
    "- The Factory Method is a creational design pattern that defines an interface for creating objects but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. It allows a class to defer instantiation to subclasses.\n",
    "- In simple words, instead of creating objects directly with new or constructor calls, you call a method (the factory method) that returns an object. The exact type of the object depends on the subclass or specific implementation of that method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem Statement with Scenario\n",
    "- Imagine you're building a logistics management system that handles different types of transport vehicles like trucks, ships, or planes. Depending on the logistics plan, you want to create different transport objects.\n",
    "- But the code using transport should not worry about how to create these objects or which exact class to instantiate â€” it just needs a transport interface to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution for the Scenario\n",
    "Use the Factory Method pattern:\n",
    "- Define an abstract Logistics class with a factory method create_transport().\n",
    "- Create subclasses like RoadLogistics and SeaLogistics that override create_transport() to return Truck or Ship respectively.\n",
    "- The client code calls create_transport() and works with the transport object without knowing the exact type.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to Use Factory Method\n",
    "- When a class can't anticipate the type of objects it needs to create.\n",
    "- When a class wants its subclasses to specify the objects it creates.\n",
    "- To avoid tight coupling between the creator and the concrete product classes.\n",
    "- When you want to localize the knowledge of which concrete class gets instantiated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros\n",
    "- Provides flexibility to introduce new types of products without changing client code.\n",
    "- Promotes loose coupling between creator and product.\n",
    "- Encapsulates object creation, improving code organization and readability.\n",
    "- Supports open/closed principle (open for extension, closed for modification).\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons\n",
    "- More classes and complexity can be introduced (due to many subclasses).\n",
    "- Sometimes overkill if there's only one or two types of products.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relations with Other Patterns\n",
    "- Abstract Factory: Factory Method creates a single product; Abstract Factory creates families of related products.\n",
    "- Template Method: Factory Method is often used in the Template Method pattern to delegate the creation of objects.\n",
    "- Builder: Both deal with object creation but Builder focuses on step-by-step construction, Factory Method on object instantiation.\n",
    "- Strategy: Factory Method can be used to instantiate strategies dynamically.\n",

    "\n",
    "Simple Explanation\n",
    "- Imagine a file system with files and folders.\n",
    "- A folder can contain files or other folders (which themselves contain files).\n",
    "- You want to treat files and folders the same way when, for example, listing contents or calculating total size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem Statement (Scenario)\n",
    "- You want to build a graphic application where shapes can be individual (circle, square) or groups of shapes.\n",
    "- You want the client code to treat both single shapes and groups uniformly, like calling draw() on both.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution\n",
    "- Define a Component interface with common operations (draw(), get_size()).\n",
    "- Create Leaf classes for individual objects (e.g., Circle).\n",
    "- Create Composite classes for groups of objects (e.g., Group) that hold Components.\n",

    "\n",
    "Simple Explanation\n",
    "- Imagine you have a simple coffee object.\n",
    "- You want to add features like milk, sugar, or whipped cream to the coffee dynamically.\n",

    "- Creating subclasses for every combination (e.g., CoffeeWithMilk, CoffeeWithSugarAndMilk) is impractical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution\n",
    "- Create a Component interface (e.g., Coffee) with a common method (e.g., cost()).\n",
    "- Create a Concrete Component class implementing that interface (SimpleCoffee).\n",
    "- Create Decorator classes that wrap the component and add behavior (e.g., MilkDecorator).\n",

    "- The proxy object has the same interface as the real object and controls access to it, adding extra functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple Explanation\n",
    "- Imagine you want to control access to a heavy object, like a large image or a remote service.\n",
    "- Instead of loading or calling the real object directly every time, you use a proxy that delays the loading or adds security checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem Statement (Scenario)\n",
    "- You have a large image that takes time and resources to load.\n",
    "- You want to delay loading the image until it's really needed (lazy loading).\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution\n",
    "- Create a proxy class that implements the same interface as the real class.\n",
    "- Proxy holds a reference to the real object but only creates/loads it when necessary.\n",
    "- Proxy controls access to the real object.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to Use Proxy Pattern\n",
    "- To control access to a resource (e.g., remote, expensive to create, sensitive).\n",
    "- To implement lazy loading (loading on demand).\n",
    "- To add security, logging, or caching without changing real object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros\n",
    "- Improves performance by delaying expensive operations.\n",
    "- Adds extra functionalities transparently.\n",
    "- Clients use proxy as if it were the real object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons\n",
    "- Adds an extra level of indirection.\n",
    "- Can complicate debugging.\n",
    "- Slight overhead due to proxy calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relation to Other Patterns\n",
    "- Related to Decorator, but Proxy controls access, Decorator adds responsibilities.\n",
    "- Often used with Factory to create proxy instances.\n",
    "- Can work with Adapter to match interfaces."

    "- Level 1 support handles simple issues.\n",
    "- If unable, passes the request to Level 2 support.\n",

    "- You want the request to be passed along until it's handled.\n",

    "Solution\n",
    "- Create a Handler interface with a method to process the request and a reference to the next handler.\n",

    "- Provides code reuse by enforcing common algorithm structure.\n",
    "- Allows easy extension of specific steps.\n",
    "- Helps keep the algorithm stable and flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons\n",
    "- Can be inflexible if the overall algorithm needs to change.\n",

    "Relation to Other Patterns\n",
    "- Often used with Factory Method to create parts of the algorithm.\n",
    "- Related to Strategy Pattern (both deal with algorithms but template method uses inheritance, strategy uses composition).'''"

    "## Visitor Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "What is it?\n",
    "- A behavioral design pattern.\n",
    "- Lets you separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate.\n",
    "- Allows adding new operations without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple Explanation\n",
    "- Imagine a collection of different animals (dog, cat, bird).\n",
    "- You want to perform different operations on them (like feeding, grooming), but you want to keep animals' classes unchanged.\n",
    "- The visitor pattern lets you define new operations in visitor classes and apply them to animal objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem Statement (Scenario)\n",
    "- You have an object structure with different types of elements.\n",
    "- You want to perform various unrelated operations on these objects without changing their classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution\n",
    "- Define a Visitor interface with a visit method for each element type.\n",
    "- Each element (class) implements an accept(visitor) method, which calls visitor's corresponding visit method.\n",
    "- New operations are added by creating new visitor classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to Use Visitor Pattern\n",
    "- When you want to perform operations across a set of heterogeneous objects.\n",
    "- To add new operations without modifying object structures.\n",
    "- When object classes rarely change but operations often change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros\n",
    "- Makes adding new operations easy.\n",
    "- Keeps related operations together.\n",
    "- Separates unrelated behaviors from object structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons\n",
    "- Adding new element classes is hard because visitor interface must change.\n",
    "- Can violate encapsulation by exposing internal details to visitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relation to Other Patterns\n",
    "- Often used with Composite pattern to traverse object structures.\n",
    "- Related to Double Dispatch to invoke correct visitor method.\n",
    "- Complements Iterator pattern to traverse elements.''"
