# What is React?
'''open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components. It's used for handling the view layer in web and mobile applications, and allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the state of those components efficiently.'''
# What is the history behind React‚Äôs evolution?
''' XHP is a PHP extension which improved the syntax of the language such that XML document fragments become valid PHP expressions and the primary purpose was used to create custom and reusable HTML elements. It was  created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook (now Meta). It was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and on Instagram in 2012.'''
# üëâ What are the major features of React?
'''Component-Based Architecture, Virtual DOM, JSX (JavaScript XML), Unidirectional Data Flow, Declarative UI, React Hooks, Context API, Error Boundaries, Server-Side Rendering (SSR), Concurrent Mode, React Server Components, Suspense'''
# What is JSX?
''' it just provides the syntactic sugar for the React.createElement(type, props, ...children) function, giving us expressiveness of JavaScript along with HTML like template syntax.'''
# üëâWhat is the difference between an Element and a Component?
'''
Element - A React Element is a plain JavaScript object that describes what you want to see on the UI. It represents a DOM node or a component at a specific point in time.
Component - A Component is a function or class that returns an element (or a tree of elements) to describe part of the UI. Components can accept inputs (called props) and manage their own state (in case of class or function components with hooks).
- Components allow you to split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, each isolated and composable.
- You can define a component using a function or a class'''
# üëâHow do you create components in React?
'''
Function Components: Those are pure JavaScript functions that accept props object as the one and only one parameter and return React elements to render the output.
Class Components: You can also use ES6 class to define a component. The above function component can be written as a class component
