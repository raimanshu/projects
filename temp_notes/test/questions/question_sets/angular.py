# ‚úÖüëâ Angular Framework
'''Angular is a TypeScript-based open-source front-end platform that makes it easy to build web, mobile and desktop applications. It is developed and maintained by Google and provides features like declarative templates, dependency injection, end to end tooling which ease application development etc.'''
# ‚úÖ AngularJS vs Angular
# ‚úÖ TypeScript
# ‚úÖ What are the key components of Angular - Components, Modules, Templates, Services, Directives
# ‚úÖüëâ  What are directives - 
'''classes that add behaviour to an existing DOM element or an existing component instance. types - Components, Structural Directives, and Attribute Directives'''
# ‚úÖ components
# ‚úÖ Component vs Directive
# ‚úÖ template 
# ‚úÖ template property - HTML view is defined inline
# ‚úÖ templateUrl property - HTML view is defined in a separate file
# ‚úÖ module
'''module is a set of angular basic building blocks like components, directives, services etc. An application is divided into logical pieces and each piece of code is called as "module" which perform a single task.
- @NgModule - used to define a module
- imports - used to import other dependent modules. 
- BrowserModule - required by default for any web based angular application.
- declarations - used to define components in the respective module.
- bootstrap -  tells Angular which Component to bootstrap in the application.
- providers -  used to configure a set of injectable objects that are available in the injector of this module.
- entryComponents -  set of components dynamically loaded into the view. '''
# ‚ùåüëâlifecycle hooks - 
'''Angular application goes through an entire set of processes or has a lifecycle right from its initiation to the end of the application.
- ngOnChanges: When the value of a data bound property changes, then this method is called.
- ngOnInit: Called once after the first ngOnChanges(). Used for initialization.
- ngDoCheck: Called during every change detection run. Used for custom change detection.
- ngAfterContentInit: This is called in response after Angular projects external content like ng-content into the component's view.
- ngAfterContentChecked: This is called in response after Angular checks the content projected into the component.
- ngAfterViewInit: This is called in response after Angular initializes the component's views and child views.
- ngAfterViewChecked: This is called in response after Angular checks the component's views and child views.
- afterRender() - Runs after each render cycle of the component's view.
- afterNextRender() - Runs only after the next render and then unsubscribes.
- ngOnDestroy: This is the cleanup phase just before Angular destroys the directive/component.
'''
# ‚úÖ data binding
'''allows to define communication between a component and the DOM
From the Component to the DOM: interpolation {{ value }}, property binding  [property]=‚Äùvalue‚Äù
From the DOM to the Component: event binding,  (event)=‚Äùfunction‚Äù
Two-way binding: [(ngModel)]=‚Äùvalue‚Äù'''
# ‚úÖ What is metadata 
'''used to decorate a class so that it can configure the expected behavior of the class.
- Class decorators, e.g. @Component and @NgModule
- Property decorators Used for properties inside classes, e.g. @Input and @Output
- Method decorators Used for methods inside classes, e.g. @HostListener
- Parameter decorators Used for parameters inside class constructors, e.g. @Inject, @Optiona'''
# ‚úÖ What is Angular CLI
'''command line interface to scaffold and build angular apps using nodejs style (commonJs) modules.'''
# ‚ùå constructor and ngOnInit
'''Constructor is a special method that is called when an instance of the class is created. It is used for initializing class members and dependencies. ngOnInit is a lifecycle hook that is called after the component's constructor and after Angular has initialized all data-bound properties and depencies.'''
# ‚úÖ What is a service
'''service is used when a common functionality needs to be provided to various modules. Services allow for greater separation of concerns for your application and better modularity by allowing you to extract common functionality out of components'''
# ‚úÖ‚≠ê What is dependency injection in Angular
'''Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern allowing a class to receive its dependencies from an external source rather than creating them itself. In Angular, DI is used to provide instances of services to components and other services.'''
# ‚ùåüëâü§î How is Dependency Hierarchy formed
# ‚úÖ Module injector -
'''Module injector is created for each module and it is used to provide services to the components declared in that module. It is created when the module is loaded and destroyed when the module is unloaded.'''
# ‚úÖ Platform Module
'''During application bootstrapping angular creates a few more injectors, above the root injector goes the platform injector, this one is created by the platform browser dynamic function inside the main.ts file, and it provides some platform-specific features like DomSanitizer.'''
# ‚úÖ NullInjector 
''' responsibility of this injector is to throw the error if something tries to find dependencies there, unless you've used @Optional() because ultimately, everything ends at the NullInjector() and it returns an error or, in the case of @Optional(), null.'''
# ‚úÖ ElementInjector
'''Angular creates ElementInjector hierarchies implicitly for each DOM element. ElementInjector injector is being created for any tag that matches the angular component, or any tag on which directive is applied, and you can configure it in component and directive annotations inside the provider's property, thus, it creates its own hierarchy likewise the upper one.'''
# ‚úÖ purpose of async pipe
''' AsyncPipe subscribes to an observable or promise and returns the latest value it has emitted. '''
# ‚úÖ What is the option to choose between inline and external template file -  depends on requirement
# ‚úÖ purpose of *ngFor directive - used to display each item in the list
# ‚úÖ purpose of ngIf directive - inserts or removes an element based on a truthy/falsy condition.
# ‚úÖ What happens if you use script tag inside template 
'''Angular recognizes the value as unsafe and automatically sanitizes it, which removes the script tag but keeps safe content such as the text content of the script tag.'''
# ‚úÖ interpolation
'''way to bind data from the component to the template by using double curly braces {{ }}. It allows you to display dynamic values in the template.'''
# template expressions
'''A template expression produces a value similar to any Javascript expression. Angular executes the expression and assigns it to a property of a binding target; the target might be an HTML element, a component, or a directive. '''
# What are template statements
'''template statement responds to an event raised by a binding target such as an element, component, or directive. The template statements appear in quotes to the right of the = symbol like (event)="statement"'''
# How do you categorize data binding types
'''
From the Component to the DOM: interpolation {{ value }}, property binding  [property]=‚Äùvalue‚Äù, attribute binding [attr.attributeName]="value", class binding [class.className]="value", style binding [style.styleName]="value"
From the DOM to the Component: event binding,  (event)=‚Äùfunction‚Äù, on-target="function"
Two-way binding: [(ngModel)]=‚Äùvalue‚Äù'''
# What are pipes -  
'''functions that use template expressions to accept data as input and transform it into a desired output. {{ birthday | date }}'''
# What is a parameterized pipe
'''parameterized pipe can be created by declaring the pipe name with a colon ( : ) and then the parameter value. If the pipe accepts multiple parameters, separate the values with colons, {{ birthday | date:'dd/MM/yyyy'}}'''
# How do you chain pipes - {{  birthday | date:'fullDate' | uppercase}}
# What is a custom pipe
'''A custom pipe is a user-defined pipe that allows you to create your own transformation logic for data. You can create a custom pipe by implementing the PipeTransform interface and using the @Pipe decorator.'''
# @Pipe({name: 'myCustomPipe'})
# PipeTransform interface
'''interface PipeTransform {
  transform(value: any, ...args: any[]): any
}''' 
# Give an example of custom pipe
# What is the difference between pure and impure pipe
'''Pure pipes are only executed when the input data changes, while impure pipes are executed on every change detection cycle. Pure pipes are more efficient as they do not require constant re-evaluation.'''
# What is a bootstrapping module
'''The bootstrapping module is the root module of an Angular application that is responsible for launching the application. It is typically defined in the main.ts file and uses the platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule() method to bootstrap the root module.'''
# What are observables
'''Observables are a way to handle asynchronous data streams in Angular. They allow you to subscribe to data changes and react to them in real-time. Observables are part of the RxJS library and provide powerful operators for transforming, filtering, and combining data streams.'''
# What is HttpClient and its benefits
'''HttpClient is a built-in Angular service that provides a simplified API for making HTTP requests. It is part of the @angular/common/http package and offers features like request and response interception, automatic JSON parsing, and support for typed responses. Benefits include better error handling, easier testing, and improved performance compared to the older Http service.'''
# Explain on how to use HttpClient with an example
# How can you read full response
''' use observe option from HttpClient
getUserResponse(): Observable<HttpResponse<User>> {
  return this.http.get<User>(
    this.userUrl, { observe: 'response' });
}
'''
# How do you perform Error handling - need to handle in the component by passing error object as a second callback to subscribe() method.
# What is RxJS
'''RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript) is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs using observable sequences. It provides a powerful set of operators for working with asynchronous data streams, making it easier to handle complex data flows in Angular applications.'''
# What is subscribing
'''Subscribing is the process of registering an observer to an observable. When you subscribe to an observable, you provide a callback function that will be executed whenever the observable emits a new value. This allows you to react to changes in the data stream and perform actions based on those changes.'''
# What is an observable
'''An observable is a data structure that represents a stream of values over time. It can emit multiple values, complete, or error out. Observables are lazy, meaning they do not execute until there is a subscription. They are used to handle asynchronous data streams in Angular applications.'''
# What is an observer
'''An observer is an object that defines how to handle the values emitted by an observable. It typically has three methods: next() for handling emitted values, error() for handling errors, and complete() for handling completion of the observable. When you subscribe to an observable, you provide an observer to receive notifications about the data stream.'''
# ‚ùå What is the difference between promise and observable
'''
Promises are used for single asynchronous operations and can only emit a single value, while observables can emit multiple values over time and support cancellation. Observables are lazy, meaning they do not execute until there is a subscription, while promises execute immediately upon creation. Observables also provide powerful operators for transforming and combining data streams, making them more flexible for complex data flows.'''
# What is multicasting - 
'''Multicasting is a technique in RxJS that allows multiple observers to share a single observable execution. It enables the observable to emit values to multiple subscribers without creating separate instances for each subscriber. This is achieved using operators like share(), publish(), or multicast(). Multicasting can improve performance and reduce resource consumption in scenarios where multiple subscribers need to listen to the same data stream.'''
# How do you perform error handling in observables
'''const myObserver = {
  next: x => console.log('Observer got a next value: ' + x),
  error: err => console.error('Observer got an error: ' + err),
  complete: () => console.log('Observer got a complete notification'),
};'''
# What is the shorthand notation for subscribe method
'''myObservable.subscribe(
  x => console.log('Observer got a next value: ' + x),
  err => console.error('Observer got an error: ' + err),
  () => console.log('Observer got a complete notification')
);'''
# What are the utility functions provided by RxJS
'''
- Converting existing code for async operations into observables
- Iterating through the values in a stream
- Mapping values to different types
- Filtering streams
- Composing multiple streams'''
# What are observable creation functions - from(fetch('/api/endpoint'));, ajax('/api/data');, interval(1000);, fromEvent(el, 'mousemove');
# What will happen if you do not supply handler for the observer - observer just ignores notifications
# üëâ What are Angular elements
'''Angular elements are Angular components packaged as custom elements (a web standard for defining new HTML elements in a framework-agnostic way). Angular Elements host an Angular component, providing a bridge between the data and the logic defined in the component and the standard DOM APIs, thus, providing a way to use Angular components in non-Angular environments.'''
# What is the browser support of Angular Elements
# üëâ What are custom elements
'''Custom elements (or Web Components) are a Web Platform feature which extends HTML by allowing you to define a tag whose content is created and controlled by JavaScript code. The browser maintains a CustomElementRegistry of defined custom elements, which maps an instantiable JavaScript class to an HTML tag.'''
# Do I need to bootstrap custom elements - 
'''No, custom elements bootstrap (or start) automatically when they are added to the DOM, and are automatically destroyed when removed from the DOM.'''
# ‚ùåü§îExplain how custom elements works internally
# ‚ùåü§îHow to transfer components to custom elements
# ‚ùåü§îWhat are the mapping rules between Angular component and custom element
# ‚ùåü§îHow do you define typings for custom elements
# ‚ùå What are dynamic components - 
'''Dynamic components are components that are inserted into the DOM at runtime, rather than being defined statically in the template.'''
# ‚úÖ What are the various kinds of directives - structural, attribute, and component directives.
# ‚úÖ How do you create directives using CLI - ng generate directive my-directive
# ‚ùå Give an example for attribute directives
# ‚úÖ What is Angular Router
'''Angular Router is a mechanism that allows you to define navigation paths in your Angular application. It enables you to create single-page applications (SPAs) by managing the navigation between different views or components without reloading the entire page.'''
# ‚úÖ What is the purpose of base href tag
'''The base href tag is used to specify the base URL for all relative URLs in the application. It helps the Angular Router to resolve the correct paths for navigation and resource loading. It is typically defined in the index.html file as <base href="/">.'''
# ‚úÖ What are the router imports
'''@angular/router provides the necessary modules and services for routing in Angular applications. The main imports include RouterModule, Routes, and RouterOutlet. RouterModule is used to configure the router, Routes is an array of route definitions, and RouterOutlet is a directive that acts as a placeholder for the routed components.'''
# ‚úÖ What is router-outlet
'''RouterOutlet is a directive that acts as a placeholder in the template where the routed component will be displayed. It is used to render the component associated with the current route. You can have multiple RouterOutlet directives in your application to support nested routing.'''
# ‚úÖ What are router links
'''Router links are directives that allow you to navigate to different routes in your Angular application. They are typically used in anchor tags (<a>) or button elements to create clickable links that trigger navigation. The routerLink directive is used to bind the route path to the element, e.g., <a [routerLink]="['/path']">Link</a>.'''
# ‚úÖ What are active router links
'''RouterLinkActive is a directive that toggles css classes for active RouterLink bindings based on the current RouterState. i.e, The Router will add CSS classes when this link is active and remove when the link is inactive. The routerLinkActive directive is used for this purpose, e.g., <a [routerLink]="['/path']" routerLinkActive="active">Link</a>.'''
# ‚úÖ What is router state
'''RouterState is an object that represents the current state of the router, including the active route, parameters, query parameters, and data associated with the route. It provides information about the current navigation and allows you to access route-specific data. You can access the RouterState using the ActivatedRoute service or by injecting the Router service.'''
# ‚úÖ What are router events
'''Router events are events emitted by the Angular Router during navigation. They provide information about the navigation process, such as when a route is activated, deactivated, or when navigation starts or ends. You can subscribe to router events using the Router service's events property, e.g., this.router.events.subscribe(event => { ... }).
- NavigationStart,
- RouteConfigLoadStart,
- RouteConfigLoadEnd,
- RoutesRecognized,
- GuardsCheckStart,
- ChildActivationStart,

- NavigationEnd,
- NavigationCancel,
- NavigationError
- Scroll
'''
# ‚úÖ What is activated route
'''ActivatedRoute is a service that provides access to the information about the currently active route. It contains properties such as params, queryParams, data, and snapshot, which allow you to access route parameters, query parameters, and data associated with the route. You can inject ActivatedRoute into your component or service to access this information.'''
# ‚úÖ How do you define routes
'''Routes are defined as an array of route objects, where each object represents a route configuration. Each route object can have properties such as path, component, redirectTo, children, and data. The path property defines the URL path for the route, and the component property specifies the component to be rendered for that route. You can define routes in the AppRoutingModule or any feature module's routing module.'''
# ‚úÖ What is the purpose of Wildcard route
'''Wildcard route is a special route that matches any URL that does not match any of the defined routes. It is typically used to handle 404 Not Found scenarios or to redirect users to a specific page when they navigate to an undefined route. You can define a wildcard route using the path '**' and redirect it to a specific component or page.'''
# ‚úÖ Do I need a Routing Module always - No, the Routing Module is a design choice. 
# ‚úÖ What is Angular Universal
'''@angular/platform-server package module allows you to render Angular applications on the server side. It enables server-side rendering (SSR) of Angular applications, improving performance, SEO, and initial load time. Angular Universal generates static HTML content on the server, which can be sent to the client for faster rendering.'''
# ‚úÖ What are different types of compilation in Angular - Just-in-Time (JIT) and Ahead-of-Time (AOT).
# ‚úÖ What is JIT
'''type of compilation that compiles your app in the browser at runtime. JIT compilation was the default until Angular 8, now default is AOT. in angular.json. By default, aot is set to true.'''
# ‚úÖ What is AOT
'''type of compilation that compiles your app at build time, before it is served to the browser. AOT compilation converts your Angular HTML and TypeScript code into efficient JavaScript code during the build process, resulting in faster rendering and smaller bundle sizes.'''
# ‚úÖ Why do we need compilation process
'''compiler converts both Angular HTML and TypeScript code converted into efficient JavaScript code during the build phase before browser runs it.'''
# ‚úÖ What are the advantages with AOT
'''AOT compilation offers several advantages, including:
- Faster rendering: AOT compiles the templates and components at build time, resulting in faster rendering in the browser.
- Smaller bundle sizes: AOT generates optimized JavaScript code, reducing the size of the final bundle.
- Early error detection: AOT catches template errors during the build process, allowing developers to fix them before deployment.
- Improved security: AOT compiles templates into JavaScript code, making it harder for attackers to inject malicious code into the application.'''
# ‚úÖ What are the ways to control AOT compilation - template compiler options in tsconfig.json, using the --aot flag with the Angular CLI commands, or by setting the aot property to true in angular.json.
# ‚ùå What are the restrictions of metadata
# ‚úÖ What are the three phases of AOT - code analysis, code generation, and code validation.
# ‚úÖ Can I use arrow functions in AOT - No, Arrow functions or lambda functions can‚Äôt be used to assign values to the decorator properties.
# ‚úÖ What is the purpose of metadata json files
'''metadata.json files are generated during the AOT compilation process and contain information about the components, directives, pipes, and modules in your Angular application. They provide metadata about the structure and dependencies of the application, allowing the Angular compiler to optimize the code and perform static analysis.'''
# ‚úÖ Can I use any javascript feature for expression syntax in AOT - No, the AOT collector understands a subset of (or limited) JavaScript features. If an expression uses unsupported syntax, the collector writes an error node to the .metadata.json file.
# ‚úÖ What is folding
'''Folding is an optimization technique used in AOT compilation to reduce the size of the generated code. It involves removing unnecessary code and simplifying expressions by evaluating them at compile time.'''
# ‚ùå What are macros
'''The AOT compiler supports macros in the form of functions or static methods that return an expression in a single return expression.'''
# ‚úÖ Give an example of few metadata errors - Expression form not supported, Reference to a local (non-exported) symbol, Function calls are not supported, Destructured variable or constant not supported
# ‚ùå What is metadata rewriting
'''process in which the compiler converts the expression initializing the fields such as useClass, useValue, useFactory, and data into an exported variable, which replaces the expression. Remember that the compiler does this rewriting during the emit of the .js file but not in definition files( .d.ts file).'''
# ‚úÖ How do you provide configuration inheritance - tsconfig.json on angularCompilerOptions
# ‚úÖ How do you specify angular template compiler options - tsconfig.json on angularCompilerOptions
# ‚úÖ How do you enable binding expression validation - adding the compiler option fullTemplateTypeCheck in the "angularCompilerOptions" of the project's tsconfig.json
# ‚úÖ What is the purpose of $any() type cast function - disable binding expression type checking using $any() type cast function, '{{ $any(user).contacts.email }}', '{{ $any(this).contacts.email }}'
# ‚úÖ What is Non null type assertion (!) operator - suppress the Object is possibly 'undefined' error
# ‚ùå What is type narrowing

# What is a service worker and its role in Angular
'''A service worker is a script that your browser runs in the background, separate from a web page, opening the door to features that don't need a web page or user interaction like caching resources, syncing resources, push notifications, and background sync.'''
# What are the design goals of service workers
'''
- It caches an application just like installing a native application
- A running application continues to run with the same version of all files without any incompatible files
- When you refresh the application, it loads the latest fully cached version
- When changes are published then it immediately updates in the background
- Service workers saves the bandwidth by downloading the resources only when they changed.'''
# What are the differences between AngularJS and Angular with respect to dependency injection
'''
- Token: AngularJs dependency injection tokens are always strings but in angular tokens can have different types. They are often classes and sometimes can be strings.
- Quantity - In AngularJs there is exactly one injector even though it is a multi-module applications, where as in angular there is a tree hierarchy of injectors, with a root injector and an additional injector for each component.'''

'''library put together by the Angular team, which you can use in your applications to mix and match AngularJS and Angular components and bridge the AngularJS and Angular dependency injection systems.'''
# How do you test Angular application using CLI
'''Angular CLI downloads and install everything needed with the Jasmine Test framework. You just need to run ng test to see the test results. By default this command builds the app in watch mode, and launches the Karma test runner. '''
# How to use polyfills in Angular application
''' When you create a new project with the ng new command, a src/polyfills.ts configuration file is created as part of your project folder. This file includes the mandatory and many of the optional polyfills as JavaScript import statements. Let's categorize the polyfills,
- Mandatory polyfills: These are installed automatically when you create your project with ng new command and the respective import statements enabled in 'src/polyfills.ts' file.
- Optional polyfills: You need to install its npm package and then create import statement in 'src/polyfills.ts' file. For example, first you need to install below npm package for adding web animations (optional) polyfill. bash npm install --save web-animations-js  and create import statement in polyfill file. javascript import 'web-animations-js'; '''
# What are the ways to trigger change detection in Angular
'''
- ApplicationRef.tick(): Invoke this method to explicitly process change detection and its side-effects. It check the full component tree.

'''The schematics CLI is a command-line interface for working with schematics. It provides a set of commands for creating, running, and testing schematics. npm install -g @angular-devkit/schematics-cli'''
# What are the best practices for security in angular - Use the latest Angular library releases, Don't modify your copy of Angular, Avoid Angular APIs marked in the documentation as ‚ÄúSecurity Risk.‚Äù
# What is Angular security model for preventing XSS attacks - 
'''Angular treats all values as untrusted by default. i.e, Angular sanitizes and escapes untrusted values When a value is inserted into the DOM from a template, via property, attribute, style, class binding, or interpolation.'''
# What is the role of template compiler for prevention of XSS attacks - it is recommended to use offline template compiler in production deployments without dynamically generating any template.
# What are the various security contexts in Angular - HTML, Style, URL, Resource URL
# What is Sanitization Does Angular support it- 
'''Sanitization is the inspection of an untrusted value, turning it into a value that's safe to insert into the DOM. '''
# What is the purpose of innerHTML - innerHtml is a property of HTML-Elements, which allows you to set it's html-content programmatically.
# What is the difference between interpolated content and innerHTML
'''Interpolated content is a value or strings with < > that is inserted into the DOM by Angular. InnerHTML is a property of HTML-Elements, which allows you to set it's html-content programmatically.'''
# How do you prevent automatic sanitization
'''
- Inject DomSanitizer
- Mark the trusted value by calling some of the below methods - bypassSecurityTrustHtml, bypassSecurityTrustScript, bypassSecurityTrustStyle, bypassSecurityTrustUrl, bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl
Example:
constructor(private sanitizer: DomSanitizer) {
  this.dangerousUrl = 'javascript:alert("XSS attack")';
  this.trustedUrl = sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustUrl(this.dangerousUrl);

# How do you support server side XSS protection in Angular application - by using a templating language that automatically escapes values to prevent XSS vulnerabilities on the server
# Does Angular prevent HTTP level vulnerabilities
'''
- HttpClient supports a token mechanism used to prevent XSRF attacks
- HttpClient library recognizes the convention of prefixed JSON responses(which non-executable js code with ")]}',\n" characters) and automatically strips the string ")]}',\n" from all responses before further parsing'''
# What are Http Interceptors
'''part of @angular/common/http, which inspect and transform HTTP requests from your application to the server and vice-versa on HTTP responses. These interceptors can perform a variety of implicit tasks, from authentication to logging.'''
# What are the applications of HTTP interceptors - Authentication, Logging, Caching, Fake backend, URL transformation, Modifying headers
# Are multiple interceptors supported in Angular - Yes, define multiple interceptors in providers property  
# How can I use interceptor for an entire application
'''You can use same instance of HttpInterceptors for the entire app by importing the HttpClientModule only in your AppModule, and add the interceptors to the root application injector. '''


# How does Angular simplify Internationalization
'''
- Displaying dates, number, percentages, and currencies in a local format.
- Preparing text in component templates for translation.

import localeDe from '@angular/common/locales/de';

registerLocaleData(localeDe, 'de');'''
# What are the four phases of template translation
'''
- Mark static text messages in your component templates for translation
- Create a translation file
- Edit the generated translation file
- Merge the completed translation file into the app'''
# What is the purpose of i18n attribute - marks translatable content. It is a custom attribute, recognized by Angular tools and compilers. The compiler removes it after translation.
# ‚ùå What is the purpose of custom id
'''
When you change the translatable text, the Angular extractor tool generates a new id for that translation unit. Because of this behavior, you must then update the translation file with the new id every time.'''
# What happens if the custom id is not unique
'''If you use the same id for two different text messages then only the first one is extracted. But its translation is used in place of both original text messages.'''
# Can I translate text without creating an element - <ng-container i18n>I'm not using any DOM element for translation</ng-container>
# How can I translate attribute - <img [src]="example" i18n-title title="Internationlization" />
# List down the pluralization categories - =0 (or any other number), zero, one, two, few, many, other
# What is select ICU expression
'''ICU expression is is similar to the plural expressions except that you choose among alternative translations based on a string value instead of a number. Here you define those string values.
Example:
<span i18n>The person is {residenceStatus, select, citizen {citizen} permanent resident {permanentResident} foreigner {foreigner}}</span>'''
# How do you report missing translations - By default, When translation is missing, it generates a warning message such as "Missing translation for message 'somekey'"
# How do you provide build configuration for multiple locales

  ngDoBootstrap(appRef: ApplicationRef) {
    appRef.bootstrap(AppComponent); // bootstrapped entry component need to be passed
  }
}'''
# Is it necessary for bootstrapped component to be entry component - Yes
# What is a routed entry component - The components referenced in router configuration are called as routed entry components. 
# Why is not necessary to use entryComponents array every time - Because angular adds components from both @NgModule.bootstrap and route definitions to entry components automatically.
# Do I still need to use entryComponents array in Angular9 - No
# Is it all components generated in production build - No, only the entry components and template components appears in production builds.
# What is Angular compiler
''' used to convert the application code into JavaScript code. It reads the template markup, combines it with the corresponding component class code, and emits component factories which creates JavaScript representation of the component along with elements of @Component metadata.'''
# What is the role of ngModule metadata in compilation process
''' used to tell the Angular compiler what components to be compiled for this module and how to link this module with other modules.'''
# How does angular finds components, directives and pipes
'''Angular compiler finds a component or directive in a template when it can match the selector of that component or directive in that template. Whereas it finds a pipe if the pipe's name appears within the pipe syntax of the template HTML.'''

# How do you provide a singleton service - Set the providedIn property of the @Injectable() to "root", Include the service in root module or in a module that is only imported by root module. 
# What are the different ways to remove duplicate service registration
'''
- Use the providedIn syntax instead of registering the service in the module.
- Separate your services into their own module.
- Define forRoot() and forChild() methods in the module.'''
# How does forRoot method helpful to avoid duplicate router instances - If the RouterModule module didn‚Äôt have forRoot() static method then each feature module would instantiate a new Router instance, which leads to broken application due to duplicate instances.
