ANGULAR INTERVIEW QUESTIONS


subject behavour -

What is Angular Framework? - TypeScript-based open-source front-end platform that makes it
 easy to build applications with in web/mobile/desktop.
What is the difference between AngularJS and Angular?
What is TypeScript? - strongly typed superset of JavaScript created by Microsoft that adds 
Optional types, classes, async/await, and many other features, and compiles to plain 
JavaScript. 
Write a pictorial diagram of Angular architecture?
What are the key components of Angular? - components, templates, modules, services,
 metadata
What are directives? - add behaviour to an existing DOM element or an existing
 component instance.
What are components? - most basic UI building block of an Angular app which formed a
tree of Angular components.
What are the differences between Component and Directive?
What is a template? - HTML view where you can display data by binding controls to
properties of an Angular component.
What is a module? - logical boundaries in your application and the application is divided into
separate modules to separate the functionality of your application.
entryComponents -

20component%20template.
What are lifecycle hooks available? - Angular application goes through an entire set of
 processes or has a lifecycle right from its initiation to the end of the application.
What is a data binding? - allows to define communication between a component and the
 DOM, making it very easy to define interactive applications without worrying about pushing and
 pulling data.
What is metadata? - used to decorate a class so that it can configure the expected
 behavior of the class.
What is Angular CLI? - command line interface to scaffold and build angular apps using nodejs
 style (commonJs) modules.
What is the difference between constructor and ngOnInit? - TypeScript classes has a
 default method called constructor which is normally used for the initialization purpose. Whereas
 ngOnInit method is specific to Angular, especially used to define Angular bindings.
What is a service - used when a common functionality needs to be provided to various
modules.
What is dependency injection in Angular? - application design pattern in which a class
asks for dependencies from external sources rather than creating them itself.
How is Dependency Hierarchy formed?
What is the purpose of async pipe? - subscribes to an observable or promise and returns the
 latest value it has emitted.
What is the option to choose between inline and external template file? - template vs 
templateUrl
What is the purpose of *ngFor directive? - display each item in the list.

What is the purpose of ngIf directive? - Sometimes an app needs to display a view or a portion
 of a view only under specific circumstances
What happens if you use script tag inside template? - Angular recognizes the value as unsafe
 and automatically sanitizes it, which removes the <script> tag but keeps safe content such as
 the text content of the <script> tag.
What is interpolation? - Angular replaces that name with the string value of the corresponding
 component property.
What are template expressions? - produces a value similar to any Javascript expression.
What are template statements? - responds to an event raised by a binding target such as
 an element, component, or directive.
How do you categorize data binding types?
What are pipes? - A pipe takes in data as input and transforms it to a desired output.
What is a parameterized pipe? - A pipe can accept any number of optional parameters to
 fine-tune its output.
How do you chain pipes? - pipe1 | pipe2 | pipe3
What is a custom pipe?
Give an example of custom pipe?
What is the difference between pure and impure pipe? - A pure pipe is only called when
 Angular detects a change in the value or the parameters passed to a pipe. An impure
 pipe is called for every change detection cycle no matter whether the value or
 parameters changes.
What is a bootstrapping module? - Every application has at least one Angular module, the root
 module that you bootstrap to launch the application is called as bootstrapping module
What are observables? - declarative which provide support for passing messages between
publishers and subscribers in your application.
What is HttpClient and its benefits? - Angular provides a simplified client HTTP API known as
 HttpClient which is based on top of XMLHttpRequest interface.
Explain on how to use HttpClient with an example?
How can you read full response? - observe option from HttpClient,
How do you perform Error handling? - If the request fails on the server or failed to reach the
 server due to network issues then HttpClient will return an error object instead of a successful
 reponse.
What is RxJS? - RxJS is a library for composing asynchronous and callback-based code
 in a functional, reactive style using Observables.
What is subscribing? - An Observable instance begins publishing values only when 
someone subscribes to it. So you need to subscribe by calling the subscribe() method of
 the instance, passing an observer object to receive the notifications.
What is an observable? - unique Object similar to a Promise that can help manage async
code.
What is an observer? - interface for a consumer of push-based notifications delivered by an
Observable.
What is the difference between promise and observable?
What is multicasting? - practice of broadcasting to a list of multiple subscribers in a single
execution.
How do you perform error handling in observables?
What is the short hand notation for subscribe method?
What are the utility functions provided by RxJS?
What are observable creation functions? - RxJS provides creation functions for the process
 of creating observables from things such as promises, events, timers and Ajax requests.
What will happen if you do not supply handler for observer? - the observer just ignores
notifications of that type.
What are angular elements? - Angular Elements hosts an Angular component, providing a
 bridge between the data and logic defined in the component and  Standard DOM APIs, thus,
 providing a way to use Angular components in non-Angular environments .
What is the browser support of Angular Elements?

What is Angular Router? - mechanism in which navigation happens from one view to the next
 as users perform application tasks.

 index.html as the first child in the tag in order to indicate how to compose navigation URLs.
What are the router imports? - available in @angular/router instead @angular/core
What is router outlet? - The RouterOutlet is a directive from the router library and it acts as a
 placeholder that marks the spot in the template where the router should display the

 elements.
What are active router links? - the Router will add CSS classes when this link is active and
 and remove when the link is inactive.
What is router state? - RouterState is a tree of activated routes. Every node in this tree
 knows about the "consumed" URL segments, the extracted parameters, and the
 resolved data.
What are router events? - During each navigation, the Router emits navigation events through
 the Router.events property allowing you to track the lifecycle of the route.
What is activated route? - contains the information about a route associated with a component 
loaded in an outlet.
How do you define routes? - A router must be configured with a list of route definitions.
What is the purpose of Wildcard route? - If the URL doesn't match any predefined routes 
then it causes the router to throw an error and crash the app

Can I use any javascript feature for expression syntax in AOT? - No
What is folding? - a process in which the collector evaluate an expression during collection
 and record the result in the .metadata.json instead of the original expression.
What are macros? - The AOT compiler supports macros in the form of functions or static
 methods that return an expression in a single return expression
Give an example of few metadata errors?

initializing the fields such as useClass, useValue, useFactory, and data into an exported
 variable, which replaces the expression.

 Messages then only the first one is extracted.
