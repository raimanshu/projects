# What is RDMS ?
Relation Database Management System
Databases connect to the data in different files by using common data numbers or a key field
Column is called attributes or fields
Row is called record
Eg - Oracle, MySQL, etc
# Normalization in DBMS
Process of organizing data to avoid duplication and redundancy
It minimizes duplicate data, minimize or avoid data modification issues and simplify quries
# Normalization Types in DBMS
First Normal Form (FNF), Second Normal Form (SNF), Third Normal Form (TNF) and Boyce and Codd Normal Form (BCNF)
FNF 
- Each set of column must have a unique value such that multiple columns cannot be used to fetch the same row
- Each table should be organized into two, and each row should have a primary key that identifies it as unique
- The primary key is usually a single column, but sometimes more than two column can be combined to  create a single primary key
- Using FNF, data redundancy increases, as there will bemany columns with same data in multiple rows but each row as a whole will be unique
- SNF
	-  There must not be any partial dependency of any column on primary key
	- A table that has concatenated primary key, each column in the table that is not part of the primary key must depend upon the entire concatenated key for itâ€™s existence
- If any column depends only on one part of the concatenated key then the table fails SNF
- TNF
-  It applies that every non-prime attribute of  table must be dependent on primary key, or we can say that there should not be the case that non-prime attribute is determined by another non-prime attribute
- so, this transitive functional dependency should be removed from the table and also the table must be in SNF

# Data types in SQL
A data type is an attribute that specifies the type of data that the object can hold: integer data, character data, monetary data, date and time data, binary strings, and so on.
Character string data type - char(n), nchar(n), varchar(n), varchar(max), nvarchar(n), nvarchar(max)
Numeric data type - int, tinyint, smallint, bigint, money, smallmoney,decimal(precision, scale),numeric(precision, scale), float(n), real
Date and Time data type - date, datetime, datetime2, datetimeoffset, smalldatetime,  time
Binary data type - bit, binary(n), varbinary(n), varbinary(max)

Database commands
Data Definition Language (DDL) - deals with database schemes and descriptions, of how the data should reside in the database, CREATE, ALTER, DROP
Data Manipulation Language (DML) - Used to store, modify, retrieve, delete and update data in database, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
Data Control Language (DCL) - Concerned with rights, permissions and other controls of the database system, GRANT, REVOKE
Transaction Control Language (TCL) - deals with transaction within a database, COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT

Create Database Objects
To show available database - show databases;
To use/enter specific database - use database <database_name>.;
Create database - create database <database_name>;
To show available database - show databases;
To see details of specific table -  desc <table_name>;
Create table - create table <table_name>(columnA datatype, columnB datatype);

Alter Table Statements
To add column in table - alter table <table_name> add <column_name datatype>;
To drop/delete column in table - alter table <table_name> drop column <column_name>;
To modify column - alter table <table_name> alter column <column_name> <datatype>;

Drop Table Statements
To drop/delete a table - drop table <table_name>

Various Constants
- enforce rules on the table whenever rows are inserted, updated and deleted
- NOT NULL, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, CHECK
