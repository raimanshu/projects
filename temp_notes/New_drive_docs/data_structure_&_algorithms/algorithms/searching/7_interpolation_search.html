Points to remember <br /><br />

The Interpolation Search is an improvement over Binary Search <br />
Binary Search always goes to the middle element to check. On the other hand,
interpolation search may go to different locations according to the value of the
key being searched. <br />

Let's assume that the elements of the array are linearly distributed. <br />

General equation of line : y = m*x + c.<br />
y is the value in the array and x is its index.<br />

Now putting value of lo,hi and x in the equation<br />
arr[hi] = m*hi+c ----(1)<br />
arr[lo] = m*lo+c ----(2)<br />
x = m*pos + c ----(3)<br />

m = (arr[hi] - arr[lo] )/ (hi - lo)<br />

subtracting eqxn (2) from (3)<br />
x - arr[lo] = m * (pos - lo)<br />
lo + (x - arr[lo])/m = pos<br />
pos = lo + (x - arr[lo]) *(hi - lo)/(arr[hi] - arr[lo])<br />

Time Complexity: O(log2(log2 n)) for the average case, and O(n) for the worst case (recursive) <br>
O(log2(log2 n)) (iterative) <br>
Auxiliary Space Complexity: O(1) <br>
