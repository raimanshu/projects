- alternative of NPM is YARN
- In function component all html code must be wrapped inside a single div, otherwise it will throw error
-  In export default App; default is mandatory, otherwise it will throw error 
Method 1
function FunctionName() {
    return (
        <div>
            ...
        </div>
    )
} 
export default FunctionName;
Method 2
export function FunctionName() {
    return (
        <div>
            ...
        </div>
    )
} 
- we can even create a function component inside another function component and use them using FunctioName
export function FunctionName1() {
    function FunctionName2() {
        return (
            <div>
                ...
            </div>
        )
    } 

    return (
        <div>
            ...

            <FunctionName2><FunctionName2/>
        </div>
    )
} 
- we can use react inside angular because angular is a library and angular is a framework
- we can use .jsx instead .js for files in react
- variable in react donot update but state update because while using variable the component donot rerenders
- By default state is public
- we can't use one state into another component even they are in same file
- we can't use useState inside class component
- we can't update props value in the recieving component, it can only be update in parent component 
- we can pass html content also in props using this.props.children ?? 
- constructor comes in a lifecycle method of react  
- we call super() befor any other statement in constructor or other class to call it's parent class like React.Component 
- Donot call API in constructor, It should be called in componentDidMount 
- If you have used componentDidUpdate, donot update your state or props in render it may go into infinite loop
- cannot put class in fragment div but can take key value
- controlled and uncontrolled components both can be used with functional and class component
- Hot module reloading means as we make changes in code compiler tracks those changes and render it on browser
