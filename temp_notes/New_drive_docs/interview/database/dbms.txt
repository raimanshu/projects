GENERAL TOPICS
--------------
DBMS - characteristics, advantages, disadvantages
Data vs Information
Database
Database vs DBMS 

DBMS vs File System

DBMS Architecture
Three schema architecture - physical/internal level, logical/conceptual level, view/external level
Instance of database 
Data Models - ER model, Relational model, object oriented model, object-relational data model
Database Languages - DDL, DML

Database Administrator
DBMS Application Architecture - Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3

ER Model 
Entity - strong entity, weak entity 
Entity set 
Attributes
Types of attributes - simple, composite, single-valued, multi-valued, derived, NULL value

Relationship - strong, weak
Degree of relation - unary, binary, ternary
Relationship constraints - Mapping cardainality / Cradinality ratio (1:1, 1:N, N:1, N:M), Participation constraints / Minimum Cradinality constraint (Partial participation, Total participation)
ER Notations 

Extended ER Model 
Specialization
Generalization
Attribute inheritance
Participation inheritance 
Aggregation 
Abstract Entity 

Steps to create ER Diagrams - identify entity sets, identify it's attributes and types , identify relation and constraints (Cradinality ratio, Participation constraints)

Relational Model - Degree of table, Cardinality, 
RDBMS
Relational Model keys - Super key, Candidate key, Primary key, Alternate Key, Foreign Key, composite key, Compound key, Surrogate key  
Integrity Constraints - Domain constraint, Entity constraint, Refrential constraint (insert constraint, delete constraint, on delete cascade, on delete NULL), Key constraint (NOT NULL, Unique constraint, Default constraint, Check constraint, Primary key constraint, Foreign key constraint)
Transform ER Diagram into Relational Diagram 

Normalization - 1 NF, 2 NF, 3 NF
Functional Dependency (Trivial, Non-trivial)
Rules of Functional Dependency - Reflexive, Augmentation, Transitive
Annomalies if Normalization not applied - insert, delete, modified/update   




OBSERVATION
-----------
DDL vs DML
Entity vs Entity set 
simple attribute vs single-valued attribute 
DBMS vs RDBMS
ER Model vs Extended ER Model vs Relational Model
