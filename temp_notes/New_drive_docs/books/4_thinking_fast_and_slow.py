# Cognitive Dissonance: 
'''
The discomfort we feel when holding conflicting beliefs or when our behavior contradicts our beliefs, often leading to changes in thoughts or actions to resolve the inconsistency.
Example: If someone who values health continues to smoke, they might justify it by saying, "Smoking helps me relax," in order to reduce the discomfort of contradicting their health beliefs.
'''


# The Spotlight Effect: 
'''
The tendency to believe that others are paying more attention to us than they actually are.
Example: You wear a new, bright-colored shirt to a party and feel everyone is staring at you, but in reality, most people are unaware of your outfit or aren't paying as much attention as you think.
'''

# The Anchoring Effect: 
'''
The tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information (the "anchor") when making decisions, even if it's irrelevant.
Example: If you see a shirt priced at $200, and then another shirt priced at $50, the $50 shirt might seem like a bargain, even if it’s still relatively expensive, because of the initial $200 price anchor.
'''

# The Halo Effect: 
'''
The tendency for a positive impression of someone in one area to influence overall judgment of them, or vice versa for negative impressions.
Example: A person who is attractive may be assumed to also be smart, friendly, and talented, even though there is no evidence to support those assumptions beyond their looks.
'''

# Gambler’s Fallacy: 
'''
The belief that past events in a random sequence influence future events, such as thinking a coin toss is "due" to land on heads after a series of tails.
Example: After losing several bets on red at a roulette table, a gambler might believe that black is "due" to win because they think the outcomes should balance out, even though each spin is independent.
'''

# The Contrast Effect: 
'''
The tendency to perceive things differently depending on what they are compared to, such as feeling something is cheaper after seeing a more expensive option.
Example: If you're offered a regular coffee and then a fancy coffee with whipped cream and flavorings, the regular coffee might taste worse than it actually is because you just experienced the extravagant option.
'''

# Confirmation Bias: 
'''
The tendency to search for, interpret, or remember information in a way that confirms one’s pre-existing beliefs.
Example: If someone believes a specific diet works, they might only look for and remember stories of people who succeeded on that diet, while ignoring stories of people who didn’t.
'''

# The Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon: 
'''
The illusion that something you’ve just learned or noticed suddenly appears more frequently, although it may not have increased in frequency.
Example: After you learn a new word, like "serendipity," you start hearing it in conversations, reading it in books, or seeing it in movies, even though it seemed rare before.
'''

# Recency Effect: 
'''
The tendency to give undue weight to the most recent information we encounter when making decisions or forming opinions.
Example: If you’re asked to recall a list of words, you’re more likely to remember the last few words you heard, because they are freshest in your memory.
'''

# Zeigarnik Effect: 
'''
The tendency to remember uncompleted tasks better than completed ones, creating a mental urge to finish them.
Example: You start a movie but are interrupted before finishing it. You’ll likely continue to think about it until you have the chance to finish watching, as your brain wants closure on the incomplete task.
'''

# The Paradox of Choice: 
'''
The idea that too many options can lead to anxiety and dissatisfaction, rather than increasing happiness or satisfaction.
Example: When given too many options for a simple decision, like choosing from 30 different brands of cereal, you might feel overwhelmed and frustrated rather than satisfied with your choice.
'''

# Survivorship Bias: 
'''
The logical error of focusing on successful examples while overlooking failures, leading to skewed conclusions.
Example: Focusing only on successful companies like Apple and ignoring the many companies that failed to innovate or adapt, leading to the misconception that success is easy and inevitable if you follow the right steps.
