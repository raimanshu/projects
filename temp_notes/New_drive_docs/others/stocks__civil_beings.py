# ‚≠ê do not follow trend blindly, always check the fundamentals of the company

# margin of safety
'''difference between the current price and the intrinsic value of the stock'''

# region 5 - Intrinsic Value and Market Value Calculations
# üëâ market value is very deciving, so always check the fundamentals of the company

'''
non matematical ways
1. personal perception - stay updated news from money control, mint, new york times, USA market definately effects indian market so always check the news from USA
2. comparision with other companies
3. comparision with other assets like rental, gold bond, land, fd, etc

mathematical ways
1. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)
- conservative approch
- compounding
pn = p0(1+r)^n
pn = future value
p0 = present value
r = rate of return
n = number of years
- discounting
pn = p0 / (1+r)^n
pn = future value
p0 = present value
r = rate of return
n = number of years

# üëâ stock over valued or under valued
- overvalued - when the market value is higher than the intrinsic value, then sell
- undervalued - when the market value is lower than the intrinsic value, then buy
