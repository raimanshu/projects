Selection sort is a simple and efficient sorting algorithm that works by
repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion
of the list and moving it to the sorted portion of the list. <br />

Time Complexity : O(n^2) <br />
Space Complexity : O(1) <br />

  // Javascript program for implementation of selection sort

  function selectionSort(arr, n) {
    var i, j, min_idx;

    // One by one move boundary of unsorted subarray
    for (i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
      // Find the minimum element in unsorted array
      min_idx = i;
      for (j = i + 1; j < arr.length; j++) {
        if (arr[j] < arr[min_idx]) {
          min_idx = j;
        }
      }

      // Swap the found minimum element with the first element
      let temp = arr[min_idx];
      arr[min_idx] = arr[i];
      arr[i] = temp;
    }
  }

  let arr = [64, 25, 12, 22, 11];
  console.log(arr);
  selectionSort(arr);
  console.log(arr);
