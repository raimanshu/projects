In insertion sort, The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted
part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed in the correct
position in the sorted part. <br />
To sort an array of size N in ascending order iterate over the array and compare
the current element (key) to its predecessor, if the key element is smaller than
its predecessor, compare it to the elements before. Move the greater elements
one position up to make space for the swapped element. <br />

Time Complexity: O(N^2) <br />
Auxiliary Space: O(1) <br />

  function insertionSort(arr) {
    let i, key, j;
    for (i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
      key = arr[i];
      j = i - 1;

      /* Move elements of arr[0..i-1], that are  
        greater than key, to one position ahead  
        of their current position */
      while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > key) {
        arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
        j = j - 1;
      }
      arr[j + 1] = key;
    }
  }

  let arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90];
  console.log(arr);
  insertionSort(arr);
  console.log(arr);
