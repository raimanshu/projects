I've had the opportunity to work on various projects, from developing mobile applications to leading a team of developers in my previous role at XYZ Company.

    "Over the course of my career, I've worked extensively on both frontend and backend technologies. My frontend experience includes working with Angular (starting from version 6 through to versions 13/14) and later transitioning to React, which I am currently using. On the backend, I've been working with Python in recent projects, expanding my full-stack capabilities.\n",

    "1. Easily Mix with People (Strong Team Collaboration Skills)\n",
    "One of my key strengths is my ability to easily connect and collaborate with people across different teams and backgrounds. I believe effective communication and teamwork are essential for project success. Whether it's participating in daily stand-ups, cross-functional meetings, or mentoring junior developers, I am comfortable working in a team-driven environment. This quality has helped me build strong professional relationships and contribute positively to team dynamics, even in high-pressure situations.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Delegation Tendency\n",
    "One area I've been working on is delegating tasks more effectively. I tend to take ownership very seriously, and at times I've found myself trying to handle too many things myself to ensure everything is done correctly. While this comes from a place of responsibility, I've realized that trusting teammates and distributing work more efficiently leads to better collaboration and outcomes. I've been actively working on this by improving communication and aligning more closely with team workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Public Speaking / Presentations\n",
    "Another area I've been improving is public speaking, especially in formal or larger group settings. While I'm confident in one-on-one or small team discussions, presenting ideas or technical concepts to broader audiences used to be a challenge for me. To address this, I've started volunteering for team demos and internal knowledge-sharing sessions, which has helped me become more comfortable and clear in my communication.\n",
