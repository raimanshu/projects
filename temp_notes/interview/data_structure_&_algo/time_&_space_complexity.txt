TIME COMPLEXITY
- Time complexity is the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input.
- types - best case, worst case, average case
- Big O notation - O(n)
- O(1) - constant time
- O(log n) - logarithmic time (binary search)
- O(n) - linear time (linear search)
- O(n log n) - linearith (merge sort, greedy algorithms)
- O(n^2) - quadratic time (bubble sort)
- O(n^3) - cubic time
- O(2^n) - exponential time (fibonacci recursion)
- O(n!) - factorial time (n queenss, knight tour)
- O(n^n) - exponential time

SPACE COMPLEXITY
- Space complexity is the amount of memory taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input.
