- concurency vs parallelism


- process vs threads 


- multi-processing vs multi-threading vs multi-tasking vs multi-programming vs hyper-threading 
multi-processing - system with multiple processors/cpu/core 
multi-threading - multiple threads running at the same time
multi-tasking - multiple processes running at the same time by single cpu/core
multi-programming - multiple programs running at the same time
multi-processing is faster than multi-threading
